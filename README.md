# Residual Capsule Network - PyTorch
PyTorch implementation of a matrix capsule network [1] with residual blocks as head for training on more complex data (STL-10).

# Introduction
This has been part of my [master's thesis](http://todo), where more details are found.

## Architecture
![Figure 1 from paper](examples/architecture.png)
Residual-CapsNet layers when training the network on smallNORB or similar dataset. Additional residual blocks can be introduced if necessary.
